# Brainfuck Interpreter (Java) + Multiplication algorithm

## Brainfuck

This esoteric language has a limited set of one character instructions, but it is Turing complete, even if it is incredibly painful to write anything.

### Interpreter

The included interpreter was written in Java. This implementation is based on a 150 byte array for performance reasons, but it can be extended. 

It also features an optional boolean argument for printing this byte array on every iteration.
